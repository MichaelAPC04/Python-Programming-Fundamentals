# Python Programming Fundamentals Assessed Work
*Assessments 1 and 2 were completed in a group, while assessment 3 was completed individually. Assignment 1 is fully complete, whereas assessments 2 and 3 are partially completed due to time constraints, workload and the nature of the tasks.*

## Assessment 1
This assessment was about creating a Connect 4 game where you can play against an AI (you can choose its difficulty, **easy**, **medium**, **hard**) or another local player.

## Assessment 2
This assessment was about creating a program that determines the shortest distance/ path and most efficient travel time between major global cities for three different delivery service vehicles. The trips undertaken by the vehicles were also visually mapped.

## Assessment 3
This assessment was about text-based image generation whilst implementing unit testing.
